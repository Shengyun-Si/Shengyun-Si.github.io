## About Me

I am a master student in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence at Technical University of Munich. Currently, I'm completing my master thesis about safety alignment of LLMs under the supervision of [Prof. Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/). Previously, I worked as a research assistant in the NLP group at Yale University under the supervision of [Dr. Arman Cohan](https://armancohan.com/), working with [Yilun Zhao](https://yilunzhao.github.io/). My current research focuses on 1) Safety Alignment of Large Language Models, 2) LLM-based Retrieval Augmented Generation, 3) Multimodal Large Language Models.

I obtained my B.S. degree from Zhejiang University. During this period, I did my thesis about leveraging SVM algorithm to detect two-phase flow.
